# Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset based on a 5-step guide for analyzing and visualizing patterns in the data.



## 🔍 Steps Followed :

1. **Generate summary statistics**  
   - Calculated mean, median, standard deviation, and other descriptive statistics using `pandas`.

2. **Create histograms and boxplots for numeric features**  
   - Visualized distributions and outliers in numerical columns like `Age`, `Fare`, etc., using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

3. **Use pairplot/correlation matrix for feature relationships**  
   - Explored relationships between variables like `Age`, `Fare`, `Pclass`, and `Survived`.

4. **Identify patterns, trends, or anomalies in the data**  
   - Observed class-wise and gender-wise survival rates. Detected outliers in numeric features using boxplots.

5. **Make basic feature-level inferences from visuals**  
   - Inferred key survival indicators such as gender, passenger class, and fare from visual exploration.
